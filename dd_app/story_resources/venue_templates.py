			'{name} screamed "get your hands off me, my fathers a lawyer!" and {1}. {name}\'s father is not a lawyer.',

			'Bar2':' As soon as we got to the bar, {name} went straight the the back of the bar and {0}. It was probably about 2 hours since I last saw {name},'
			' I thought we lost {obj_pronoun} for the night but then I saw {name} on the dance floor. I am not sure why {subj_pronoun} was on the dance floor because {subj_pronoun}'
			' wasn\'t out there dancing, {subj_pronoun} just {1}. I had grab {name} by the shirt and pull {poss_pronoun} away or people were going to think {subj_pronoun} was insane. ',

			'Bar3':' I thought {name} was going to take it easy that night since {subj_pronoun} had to be up a 6 A.M. but that notion was thrown out the window when {subj_pronoun} {0}. '
			'I asked {name} how many drinks {subj_pronoun} had and {subj_pronoun} said, "Not that much, I am just buzzed."  Knowing {name}, {subj_pronoun} was not just buzzed. '
			'"{name} buzzed" is a lot different than normal "buzzed".  ',

			'Bar4':' {name} {name} {name}, you have really outdone yourself this time... After about an hour or two of drinking, {name} started to feel the liquid courage and began talking to '
			' one of the most attractive girls in the bar. Things were suprisingly going well until {name} ruined everything and {0}.'
			' The girl {subj_pronoun} was talking to threw her drink in {name}\'s face and stomped off. {name} was pretty down in the dumps from that point forward. '
			'Other than sitting in the corner for the rest of the night, {name} {1}, and {3}. Yeah, it was a pretty bad night for {name}' ,

			'Bar5':' For some reason {name} was having a great time at the bar even though {subj_pronoun} stepped in dog excrement on the way to the bar. {name} was talking to everyone and people seemed to enjoy {poss_pronoun} company.'
			' However, people began to notice the smell coming off {name}\'s shoe. {name} had got nervous and {0}. This made the situation worse as people began to verbally point out how bad'
			' {name} smelled.  {subj_pronoun} spent the next hour or so cleaning off {obj_pronoun} shoe. By the time {name} left the bathroom the bar was closing. As we left there a'
			' of people chanting "Poop shoe! Poop shoe! Poop shoe!". So now we call {name} "Poop shoe."' ,

			'Bar6':' I knew {name} was going to be a problem when {subj_pronoun} {0}. Following that {name} {1}. {subj_pronoun} starting to become "that guy" at the bar no one wanted to be around. '
			' I asked {name} to chill out and {subj_pronoun} barked, "I am perfectly fine you chill out mannnnn". Sigh, after that I just left {obj_pronoun} alone and later found {obj_pronoun}'
			' at the front of the bar crying. I wasn\'t suprised.' ,

			'Bar7':' When I found out {name} was tagging along I was nervous because {name} is known'
			' for being a loose cannon when {subj_pronoun} drinks. One time we went out, {name} got thrown out of the Bar because'
			' {subj_pronoun} was writing poems about Pokemon on the bathroom stalls. However, this time,'
			' {name} {0}. At first I thought the night couldn\'t get any worse, but then {name} {1}. Yeah, '
			' next time {name} is coming out with us I might rethink being the designated driver.' ,

			'Bar8':' Where do I begin with {name}. {name} had just recently broken up with {poss_pronoun}'
			' significant other so I knew tonight {name} would be a wildcard.  {name} started off the'
			' night by "flirting" with the bartender, and by flirting I mean {subj_pronoun} {0}. Following that,'
			' {name} {1}. The group started getting frustrated with {name} when {subj_pronoun} {3}, so we ended the'
			' the night early to save any further headache.' ,

			'Bar9':' {name} {0}, then {1}, and {2}. Enough said.',
