# IAMTHE DD
iamthedd, short for "I am the Designated Driver" is a story generator that depicts a night out with friends. 
Users create an account that allows them to create groups of friends called "crews". When adding people to "crews" users assign
a personality trait that most applies to them when the go out drinking with friends. This "personality" will dictate how their story 
is generated.

When a user wants to generate a story all they have to do is give the story a name, select a venue where the story will take place
(Bar, Club, House, ect.) and select the crew that will be involved.

The app then generates a short story for each member of the "crew" that will be told throught he perspective of the designated driver(the user).
