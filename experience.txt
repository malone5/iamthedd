Toughest Problem: Figuring out how to format CrewMember substories in a random fashing

Problem I had to overcome:
- needed the ammount of actions to NOT be fixed so sotries could be unique.
	-this was acheived by creating a random list of 5 actions based on personality. I chose 5 because most substories will not contain more than 5(howver this can easily be adjusted). 
	-this way I could unpack them as the story_template was being parsed. And it would not interfere with other keyword args that were nescessary.

- had to accomidate name, subjective pronouns, and objective pronouns. Along with a random list of actions

- creatStory(*actions, name=name, obj_pronoun, subj_pronoun)
	-could succesfully accomate any story template



Tried:
-Tried to make a fixed number of actions per substory but I wanted more for a better user experience.


----------------------------------------------------------------

Design changes if i had mroe time:

Would like to make adding venues and story templtes to be dynamic thought he database. As of now it is hardcoded for time.

Another challenge:

Creating the story
-Automatically setting the Creator as the logged in user.
-Showing just the crews of the logged in user
-generating all the substories of the crew.

----------------------
What would I havedon different.

Made it much more simple without accounts/multiple crews/stories.
Just a simple application where people could open the page, crete the crew and generate the story really quick.
